            <h3>λ is a tech group that focuses on modifying technology, right to repair, and opensource software.</h3>
        <p>We believe that every person should have the ability to access technology and software, and that companies
            shouldnt have all the control when the user are forced to use the products, great examples of this are 
            <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">Google killing off products</a> that they bought out and made worse, 
            <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/astonishing-anti-repair-practices-by-apple-in-the-last-15-years.2409918/".>
                Apple making it harder to repair devices</a>, the <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-third-party-client-api-rules">
                unfair</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-59011271">suspicous</a> events that happened with twitter</p>
        <p>So λ wants to be straight forward;</p>
        <a>
            <bold>we stand for the users, we stand with companies like <a href="https://frame.work/de/en">Framework</a>
            <a>we stand with the planet, and we stand with independent developers, and we hope you'll stick around with us.</bold></a>
